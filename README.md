# CS-255 - JOSEPH TRICHE
Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass was a company that wished to create a system that offered practice tests that prepared students to take their driving exam at the DMV. The system would also be able to make driving lesson reservations. In this course, we utilized an interview transcript to devise the requirements of the system. These requirements then became the basis for the UML diagrams.

What did you do particularly well?

I believe I did a good job capturing the functional and non-functional requirements of my client. I carefully worked through the interview transcript and wrote all of his wants down, then used that list to devise the requirements.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The technical requirements and the class diagram. For both, I really didn't know what I was doing. I have no clue what the technical requirements would be, because I do not know how cloud-based services are run or even to make a cloud-based service. I can write some C++ code to print things to a screen and that's about it. Likewise, the class diagram was too much for me at this stage. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I feel like I learned a lot in this course about gathering information and translating that information into design. While coding is my favorite part of the process, I recognize that design is a major part of software developement. It's important to listen carefully to your client and to accurately record their needs. They are paying you to make the software that they want, not the software that you want. You must also consider the user experience, and how the functionality of the program will be enacted from the perspective of the user. I can see many of the concepts I've learned in this course being applied in the future. We've learned about all the different ways to gather user requirements and how to effectively communicate those requirements to the development team using UML diagrams. I see myself using these diagrams the next time I must work out a complicated project. Especially the data flow diagrams, which seem like a good way to break a project down from a high level to a low level. I also know that I'll be using A LOT of class diagrams, so I must continually work to improve both my understanding and application of these diagrams.
